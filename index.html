        <h1>Javascript as a programming Language</h1>
        <p>Welcome to this introduction to JavaScript programming. JavaScript is the third component of the so-called
            trinity of
            web development, alongside HTML and CSS. JavaScript actually predates CSS! The first commercial release of
            JavaScript was in late 1995. It was originally called LiveScript, but the name changed to JavaScript after a
            couple
            of months.</p>

        <aside>
            <p>Contrary to what you might think, JavaScript is not related to or connected to the Java programming
                language. It's been said that the name was an attempt to cash in on Java's success, but it still makes
                seasoned
                developers twitch a little bit when people get the two languages mixed up. JavaScript is an imperative
                language,
                so
                it's a bit different from the declarative languages of HTML and CSS that you may be used to.</p>

            <p>It's not unusual to feel overwhelmed when you start to learn JavaScript, and it does take practice to get
                used to
                writing JavaScript
                code. Sometimes, it's good just to walk away from the computer for a while rather than staring at the
                code. It's
                easy to get into what I call the "Whirlpool of Despair", so sometimes a walkout to get a coffee or to
                bring the
                dog
                out is all that's needed to reset your brain. But again - we'll say it again - don't try to remember
                everything!
                Just try to comprehend the principles of what the code is doing.</p>

            <p>If you understand the basic reason why the code works, then syntax can be corrected later. Also, play
                with the
                runnable examples and see what happens,
                because it's a great way of helping you to understand what the code does. Again, there are some
                challenges to
                testing what you're
                learning. So, be curious about the code, dive in, and enjoy this introduction to JavaScript.</p>

            <h1>Javascript as a programming langguage</h1>
            <p>Lets you enhance your HTML with animation, interactivity, and dynamic visual effects. It can make
                webpages more
                useful by supplying immediate feedback. For example, a JavaScript powered shopping cart can instantly
                display a
                total cost with taxes and shipping the moment a user selects a product to buy. Javascript is used when
                determining whether the credit card details you entered were valid before transferring those details
                across the
                net to the bank for processing, client-side validation it's called.

                <p>Javascript is now the language of the web. For years, it was only run in browsers to operate on HTML.
                    Now it also runs on servers and is powerful as many of the programming languages you will encounter
                    in a
                    later module.
                    We just called JavaScript a programming language but let's pause for a second and describe what a
                    computer
                    program is.
                    Well a computer program is a set of instructions given to a computer that are carried out in a
                    designated
                    sequence
                    in order to carry out some task. The key words here are instructions and sequence.
                    Once you know the steps, you're ready to write your program. In other words you'll translate your
                    ideas into
                    programming code.</p>

                <p>Programming languages are used to create computer programs, they use code. Now code is made up of
                    symbols and
                    characters
                    that are understood both by developers and the computer. A programming language allows you to meet
                    the
                    computer halfway
                    when you want to do something. Now JavaScript is what's called an imperative language, now you'll
                    cover this
                    in a lot more detail
                    later, but put simply JavaScript can make logical decisions. HTML and CSS are declarative
                    programming
                    languages
                    that is, they're only concerned with how something is displayed. So how do we add JavaScript to a
                    web page?
                    Well web browsers are built to understand HTML and CSS and convert those languages into a visual
                    display on
                    the
                    screen. To do this the browser uses what's called a layout or rendering engine. This is the part of
                    the web
                    browser that understands HTML and CSS. Now a browser also contains what's called a JavaScript
                    interpreter.
                    This
                    is the part of the browser that understands JavaScript and it can execute the steps of a JavaScript
                    program.
                </p>
                <hr>

                <h2>How does the engine work</h2>

                <p>Engines are complicated but the basics are easy
                    <ol>
                        <li>1) The engine (embedded if it is a browser) reads ("parses") the script.</li>
                        <li>2) Then it converts ("compiles") the sript to the machine language.</li>
                        <li>3) And then the machine code runs pretty fast.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>The engine applies optimizations at each step of the process. It even watches the compiled script
                        as it
                        runs, analyzes the data
                        that runs through it, and further optimises the machine code based on that knowledge.</p>

                    <p>Now, a web browser is usually expecting HTML but we must specify or tell the browser when
                        JavaScript is
                        included. And to do this we used the script tag. This is similar to the style tag used in CSS,
                        also like
                        CSS, JavaScript can be included in the head element are accessed from an external file. But
                        JavaScript
                        doesn't have to be confined to the head elemental though. You can insert script elements in the
                        body
                        area too
                        creating islands of behavior or functionality throughout the page.</p>

                    <p>>In fact, it's often recommended that you place your JavaScript as the last element inside the
                        body
                        of a page. Why? Well because JavaScript <em>mainly</em> operates on HTML element's as part of
                        task.
                        Javascript is designed to be able to travel the element family tree or <em>DOM</em> and access,
                        modify,
                        add, or even delete elements on that tree.</P>
                    <p> If the JavaScript appears in the head of a page it might attempt to access elements that have
                        not yet
                        been interpreted by the browser. That is because they might not have been added to the
                        <em>family tree in memory.</em>
                        These elements need to have first been read by the browser interpreter in order for JavaScript
                        to access
                        them on the tree.</P>
                    <p>So let's have a look at some JavaScript grammar, well learning a programming language is a lot
                        like
                        learning any new language. There are words to learn, punctuation to understand, and a new set of
                        rules to master.
                        Just as you need to learn the grammar of Spanish to
                        speak Spanish you must become familiar with the grammar of JavaScript to program JavaScript.
                        Now once you know the fundamentals of one programming language you know the fundamental's more
                        or less of all of them.</p>
                    <p>Now you'll cover the fundamentals of programming languages in much more detail in a later module.
                        But now we'll take a quick look at what a minimal two line JavaScript program looks like.
                        Now Javascript allows us to directly interact with the document object model.
                        In our example here we access the data what's called a document object.
                        When an HTML document is loaded into a web browser it becomes the document object model or the
                        document
                        object. The document object is the root node of the HTML and it's the owner of all the other
                        nodes or elements or
                        the parent of them. The document object provides properties and methods to access all node
                        objects from within
                        JavaScript.

                    <hr>
                    <h2>Example</h2>
                    <h3>document.mydocument(document1)
                        console.log(document1)
                    </h3>

                    <p> In our example above, we use the document object to write to the screen, twice. The first
                        time we
                        write some HTML formatted text to the screen just to sure you can either convert the text
                        into and recognize
                        the tags. Now the second time we write the sum of two numbers to the screen, JavaScript uses
                        what's called dot
                        notation. On the left we see a word called document, this word represents the document
                        object both suited to
                        the developer and to the browser. It's then followed by a dot and then another word with
                        parentheses and some
                        text inside the parentheses. Everything after the dot is called a function, function does
                        something.

                        <p>The name tells us what the function does, in this case it will just write something to
                            the screen.
                            The text inside the parenthesis is what will be evaluated and written to the screen.
                            This illustrates Javascripts ability to work with and even create HTML events on the
                            fly. And secondly, it can perform tasks such as mathematical
                            operations.Now notice that this content is added dynamically. That is when the page is
                            created there are no elements
                            inside in the body tags it's only when the page is run in a browser does the JavaScript
                            run</p>

                    </p>The name tells us what the function does, in this case it will just write something to the
                    screen.
                    The text inside the parenthesis is what will be evaluated and written to the screen.
                    This illustrates Javascripts ability to work with and even create HTML events on the fly. And
